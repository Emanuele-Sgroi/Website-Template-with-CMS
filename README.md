## Description

I volunteered to design and develop a professional and responsive website for MARTINA VECCHIO, a young girl that is launching a new business in Italy. The website was built with react and Sanity. Furthermore, the website uses services such as emailJS and frameworks like framer-motion and react-router.

### Note: The website contains Italians words that are statics and not fetched from any CMS/Database

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Sanity.io
- EmailJS
- React Router
- Framer Motion
- HashLink

## Features

This website is designed with attention to detail and functionality, offering users a seamless and interactive experience. Key features include:

1. **Interactive and Responsive Design**: Optimized for a wide range of devices, providing a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

2. **Custom Content Management System (CMS)**: Integrated with Sanity.io, enabling easy and real-time updates to website content without needing to change the codebase.

3. **Dynamic Email Integration**: Utilizes EmailJS for seamless email communication directly from the website, enhancing user engagement and support.

4. **Advanced Routing**: Built with React Router, offering smooth navigation within the application without page reloads.

5. **Sophisticated Animations**: Leveraging Framer Motion to provide fluid and attractive animations, enhancing the visual appeal and user interaction.

6. **Smooth Scrolling and Navigation**: Implements HashLink for an improved scrolling experience, allowing users to navigate easily to different sections of the website.

7. **Customized Forms and Validation**: Features robust forms with validation, ensuring a user-friendly interface for inquiries and feedback.
